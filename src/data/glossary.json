The rule assumes that a visitor would get frustrated and abandon his information seeking task if it takes more than 3 clicks. However, there has been no data or studies to corroborate the assertions made by the rule."

Information architecture or IA as it is commonly known, refers to how information is organized on a website or application. Card sorting is a UX research technique that helps site owners improve information architecture by getting users involved in structuring the content of the website. This typically involves a session where the various elements of the website are written down as cards and users are asked to collect them into groups."

Though qualitative research methods like usability testing, surveys or user interviews can help you understand various aspects of the user, you need a visualization tool to distill and capture who your users are as a whole. Empathy mapping, a technique employed in the beginning of the UX process can help you achieve this. Empathy maps are divided into four quadrants. With each quadrant capturing what the user says, thinks, does, and feels."

Even though it relates to skeuomorphism, where interface components mimic their real-world counterparts in how they appear or how a user can interact with them, neumorphism’s aesthetic lies on its minimal, flat yet realistic UI.<br>Neumorphic UI elements look like they’re connected to the background, as if the elements are extruded or inset into the background. They are also referred as “soft UI” because of the way soft shadows are used to create this blending effect."
